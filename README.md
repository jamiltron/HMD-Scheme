HMD Scheme
----------

A little Scheme implementation (for certain definitions of 'Scheme') using
a form of Hindley-Milner-Damas type inference. Right now evalS kind of works,
and it passes some type checking tests. I will be further expanding this and supply
a live web demo whenever I have time. Also hopefully I'll start writing some sort
of a compiler for this in Haskell at some point.

This takes a lot of influence/code-adaptation from:
